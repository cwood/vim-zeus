1. Overview~
                                                *ztscomplete-overview*
The purpose of this script is to auto-complete TrafficScript functions by providing 
and 'omnifunc' for TrafficScript.

In a TrafficScirpt file( a file with .zts suffix or a file in $ZEUSHOME/zxtm/conf/rules/ directory ), you can use CTRL-X CTRL-O or TAB to complete function names in 'Insert' mode. The completion gives a description of the function being completed, its parameters and sample code.

You can set a "may complete" behaviour to start a completion automatically
after a '.'.

2. Downloads~
                                                *ztscomplete-download*

3. Installation~
                                                *ztscomplete-installation*
3.1. Script installation~

Unzip the downloaded file in your personal |vimfiles| directory (~/.vim under 
unix ). The 'omnifunc' will be automatically set for files ending with '.zts'.

Make sure your .vimrc file contains these lines for the plugin to work correctly.

        set nocp
        filetype plugin on
        set completeopt=menuone,menu,longest,preview

For VIM to be able to recognize that a file is of 'TrafficScript' type, create a file called 'filetype.vim' in '~/.vim/after' ( if it doesn't exist ) and add these lines to it.

        augroup filetypedetect
	   au BufNewFile,BufRead *.zts,*/conf/rules/*  set filetype=zts syn=zts
	augroup END

You can also acheive this by adding the above lines to your '.vimrc' file, but this approach is less optimized.


For syntax highlighting and auto indentation, add these lines to the '.vimrc' file as well.
	syntax on
	set shiftwidth=3
	set smartindent
        

To verify that things are working, just open a file with '.zts' suffix and run ':helptags ~/.vim/doc, and then try to auto-complete some TrafficScript functions. Use ':help ztscomplete' to view this help text.

3.1.1. Files~

After installation you should find these files ( along with any existing files
) :

    after\ftplugin\zts.vim

    autoload\zeus\zts\complete.vim
                     \functions.vim
                     \popup.vim
                     \maycomplete.vim
                     \compile.vim
                     \settings.vim
                     \utils.vim

    doc\zeuscomplete.txt

4. Features~

                                                *ztscomplete-features*

This section outlines the various key-maps to use to trigger features.

4.1 Compilation:  To compile the rule, press F5 at any time. The environment
    variable ZEUSHOME should be set and point to a valid Zeus Traffic Manager
    installation on the system. The rule cannot be compiled if the installation
    is on a remote machine.

4.2 Completion: You can use TAB or <Ctrl-X><Ctrl-O> to try and complete
    the current word. A list of all possible functions starting with the current
    word will be displayed in the pop-up menu. Use the TAB or the Up/Down keys to
    select these functions and <Enter> to finish completion. The use of '.' key 
    after a full function name will give the list of all possible functions of the 
    next level.

4.3 Preview window: When a function from the completion pop-up menu is selected, 
    a preview window is opened to show details of the function that's selected.
    The preview window remains opened after you have selected and inserted the
    functions for ease of lookup while entering arguments. The preview window
    will be automatically closed when ')' is used. You can disable this behaviour
    by setting this option in your .vimrc file

           let g:ZeusZTS_AutoClosePreview = 0

    in which case the preview window can be closed by doing Ctrl-P in Insert
    mode. 
    
    You can shuffle back and forth from the preview window by using Ctrl-W
    Ctrl-W in 'Normal' mode( Press 'Esc' or the appropriate key-mapping to go the
    'Normal' mode from 'Insert' mode.)
 
4.4 Disable Auto-Complete for TrafficScript: You can disable the plugin from
    showing the list of function names to complete by simply adding this option
    to your .vimrc file
    	   
	   g:ZeusZTS_MayCompleteDot = 0
    
    This will stop auto-completion on pressing '.' but still auto-complete for TAB's.
    
====================================================================================
5. Colours~ 
							*ztscomplete-colours*
   The default colours for the pop-up menu is pink. You can fiddle around with the menu 
   colours by using these options in you '.vimrc' file.

	hi Pmenu ctermfg=0 ctermbg=6 guibg=#444444
	hi PmenuSel ctermfg=7 ctermbg=4 guibg=#555555 guifg=#ffffff

   These options will set the Pmenu color to cyan and PmenuSel color to blue.
